<P1><center>Ever since I was little, I have been into art. My father got his college degree in architecture and has always shown me how to see the art in buildings, structures, and sculptures. My mom used to own a glass painting company called "Touch of Glass". Her company was very popular in my town. All of her pieces were hand painted with a lot of detail. My grandfather is also very into art. On his free time, he regularly paints realistic nature and portraits of animals in the wild and dogs.  With both of my parents and grandfather very into art, I was constantly surrounded by it and grew to love it. My artistic side grew.</center></P1>

<P2><center>Above is a painting that I did in my art class senior year of high school. It is one of my favorite paintings I have done. For the assignment, I had to create a collage out of magazine clippings. After creating the collage, I had to magnify and copy the collage onto a canvas with only paint. It is a little strange to look at, but it is interesting and abstract.</center><P2>
