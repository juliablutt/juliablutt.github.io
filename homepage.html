<P1><center>Hi everyone! My name is Julia Blutt and I am 20 years old. I am bilingual (French and English). I am in my sophomore year here at University of Maine Orono.</center></P1> 

<P> </P>

<P2><center>I made this website for my Information Systems and Technology in Business course. I find this class very interesting because it is almost exactly what I want to major in. I am currently majoring in Business marketing and minoring in biomedical engineering as well as French. My dream is to create and come up with plans for medical supplies and prosthetics to help people all over the world, especially in third world countries.</center></P2>
