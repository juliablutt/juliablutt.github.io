<P1><center>Dance has always been a large part of my life. I took ballet and tap when I was little from 4 to 7 years old. When I went to 6th grade, I took hip hop classes and stopped in 8th grade. I took pointe and jazz classes throughout high school, as well as hip hop dance team and competition dance team.</center></P1>
